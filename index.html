<div class= "main"> New York Is Calling: The Best Hotels in Manhattan </div>
<div class= "date"> <strong>TRAVEL</strong> - APR 22, 2018 </div>
<hr>
<br>
<p class= "p"> New York is a layered city to visit. The first time you arrive in Manhattan, it's a blur of neon lights and deafening sirens, the second or third time, it's a chance to look beyond tourist attractions, and beyond that, it's about exploring&mdash;there's a never&mdash;ending list of boutiques, speakeasies, and restaurants to discover. Whether you're visiting New York City for the first time or 50th time, finding a hotel that will act as your home base is crucial. It should be centrally located (but not next to a crowded landmark), carefully designed (but still comfortable), and have a killer view of the city (because you're in Manhattan!). To cut your search time in half, we tapped our team of New York editors to share the hotels they recommend to friends and family, as well as anonymous reviews from people who have recently stayed at each spot.</p>

<div class= "date"> <strong>FOOD</strong> - APR 22, 2018 </div>

<br>
<p class= "p"> What attracts many people to unhealthy, processed food is the price&mdash;fast food restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, and the like have such low prices that some people simply can't afford to resist. While eating healthy is generally more expensive ($1 to $2 more per serving, to be exact), there are budget&mdash;friendly meals that still manage to offer some nutritional benefit. </p>

<div class= "main"> Fashion Girls Will Love These Trends</div>
<div class= "date"> <strong>STYLE</strong> - APR 22, 2018 </div>
<hr>
<br>
<p class= "p"> There's something fascinating and majestic about watching models parade down a runway in bold, exuberant outfits that you know won't even hit the shelves for another few months. Fashion reinvents itself so frequently, it's no wonder designers are at the cutting edge of creativity and trends. Twice a year, they hit the runways during fashion week to display their ultimate vision for the seasons to come. What's even more interesting is many designer collections during fashion week carry common themes&mdash;similar color palettes, fabrics, patterns, or shapes are not uncommon.</p>
